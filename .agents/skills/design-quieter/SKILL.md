<!-- Adapted from pbakaus/impeccable (Apache 2.0) -- see NOTICE.md -->

Reduce visual intensity in designs that are too bold, aggressive, or
overstimulating, creating a more refined and approachable aesthetic without
losing effectiveness.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow `/frontend-design` and its `Context Gathering Protocol` before any
design work.

- Design work must not proceed without confirmed context.
- Required context includes: target audience, primary use cases, and brand
  personality/tone.
- Context cannot be inferred from codebase structure or implementation details
  alone.
- Gather context in this order:
  1. Current instructions in the active thread.
  2. `.atlas/design.md`.
  3. `teach-design` (required on cold start).
- Stop condition: if the required context is still missing, STOP and run
  `teach-design` first. Do not continue this skill until context is
  confirmed.

## Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel too intense:

1. **Identify intensity sources**:
   - **Color saturation**: Overly bright or saturated colors
   - **Contrast extremes**: Too much high-contrast juxtaposition
   - **Visual weight**: Too many bold, heavy elements competing
   - **Animation excess**: Too much motion or overly dramatic effects
   - **Complexity**: Too many visual elements, patterns, or decorations
   - **Scale**: Everything is large and loud with no hierarchy

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the purpose? (Marketing vs tool vs reading experience)
   - Who's the audience? (Some contexts need energy)
   - What's working? (Don't throw away good ideas)
   - What's the core message? (Preserve what matters)

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, exhaust local conventions first;
ask only as a last resort.

**CRITICAL**: "Quieter" doesn't mean boring or generic. It means refined,
sophisticated, and easier on the eyes. Think luxury, not laziness.

## Plan Refinement

Create a strategy to reduce intensity while maintaining impact:

- **Color approach**: Desaturate or shift to more sophisticated tones?
- **Hierarchy approach**: Which elements should stay bold (very few), which
  should recede?
- **Simplification approach**: What can be removed entirely?
- **Sophistication approach**: How can we signal quality through restraint?

**IMPORTANT**: Great quiet design is harder than great bold design. Subtlety
requires precision.

## Refine the Design

Systematically reduce intensity across these dimensions:

### Color Refinement

- **Reduce saturation**: Shift from fully saturated to 70-85% saturation
- **Soften palette**: Replace bright colors with muted, sophisticated tones
- **Reduce color variety**: Use fewer colors more thoughtfully
- **Neutral dominance**: Let neutrals do more work, use color as accent so it
  carries only a small share of the total visual weight (roughly 10% of what
  the eye notices first)
- **Gentler contrasts**: High contrast only where it matters most
- **Tinted grays**: Use warm or cool tinted grays instead of pure gray -- adds
  sophistication without loudness
- **Never gray on color**: If you have gray text on a colored background, use
  a darker shade of that color or transparency instead

### Visual Weight Reduction

- **Typography**: Reduce font weights (900 -> 600, 700 -> 500), decrease
  sizes where appropriate
- **Hierarchy through subtlety**: Use weight, size, and space instead of color
  and boldness
- **White space**: Increase breathing room, reduce density
- **Borders & lines**: Reduce thickness, decrease opacity, or remove entirely

### Simplification

- **Remove decorative elements**: Gradients, shadows, patterns, textures that
  don't serve purpose
- **Simplify shapes**: Reduce border radius extremes, simplify custom shapes
- **Reduce layering**: Flatten visual hierarchy where possible
- **Clean up effects**: Reduce or remove blur effects, glows, multiple
  shadows

### Motion Reduction

- **Reduce animation intensity**: Shorter distances (10-20px instead of 40px),
  gentler easing
- **Remove decorative animations**: Keep functional motion, remove flourishes
- **Subtle micro-interactions**: Replace dramatic effects with gentle feedback
- **Refined easing**: Use ease-out-quart for smooth, understated motion --
  never bounce or elastic
- **Remove animations entirely** if they're not serving a clear purpose

### Composition Refinement

- **Reduce scale jumps**: Smaller contrast between sizes creates calmer
  feeling
- **Align to grid**: Bring rogue elements back into systematic alignment
- **Even out spacing**: Replace extreme spacing variations with consistent
  rhythm

**NEVER**:

- Make everything the same size/weight (hierarchy still matters)
- Remove all color (quiet != grayscale)
- Eliminate all personality (maintain character through refinement)
- Sacrifice usability for aesthetics (functional elements still need clear
  affordances)
- Make everything small and light (some anchors needed)

## Verify Quality

Ensure refinement maintains quality:

- **Still functional**: Can users still accomplish tasks easily?
- **Still distinctive**: Does it have character, or is it generic now?
- **Better reading**: Is text easier to read for extended periods?
- **Sophistication**: Does it feel more refined and premium?

Remember: Quiet design is confident design. It doesn't need to shout. Less is
more, but less is also harder. Refine with precision and maintain
intentionality.
